It‚Äôs the best! Here‚Äôs why:</h2> <p>When I first started programming CrookCatcher, back in 2014, <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lookout">Lookout</a> was the only other app that did something similar. I was 17 and teaching myself to program, so I thought it could be fun to make a better version. Today there are really quite many other apps that try to do the same thing, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bloketech.lockwatch">LockWatch</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hld.screenmonitor">Hidden Eye</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wtmp.svdsoftware">WTMP</a>, and even some that almost look like clones of CrookCatcher (won‚Äôt mention any names, cough cough.. <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evezzon.intruderdetector">Intruder Detector</a>).</p> <p>The first version of CrookCatcher was pretty basic (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.crookcatcher.app/images/blog/cc_old.png">not pretty!</a> üòÖ) but it worked. While I‚Äôve done many other things in my life since then, I also kept working on CrookCatcher and today I think CrookCatcher is really the best app out there. Why you ask? Well.. Because CrookCatcher doesn‚Äôt just take pictures, but also <em>records videos</em>, plays alarm sounds, shows a message to the thief or a <em>fake home screen</em> to fool them into thinking they‚Äôve unlocked the phone, making them click on fake apps which just causes more pictures to be taken!</p> <p>CrookCatcher can disguise itself on your home screen as a file manager icon and can require a pattern code to be opened. It can take <em>multiple pictures</em> for every failed unlock, even using the <em>back facing camera</em> so you can learn about the surroundings, and it can send pictures to multiple email addresses (TIP: just separate the receiver email addresses in CrookCatcher settings by a comma üòâ), it can even take pictures when someone guesses the right password! Oh and did I mention <em>Google Drive</em> upload?</p> <p>And since people of course don‚Äôt only use CrookCatcher to catch thieves, but also to catch their snooping spouses, children and coworkers who use their phone without permission, CrookCatcher also has a great interface for looking at pictures and videos directly in the app. It even has an immutable activity log which records when various actions in CrookCatcher are taken. Sorry for the rant, but I think that answers the question.</p> <h2 id="Ô∏è-how-it-works"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#Ô∏è-how-it-works"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>‚öôÔ∏è How it works</h2> <p>CrookCatcher uses a special permission called <em>Device Admin</em> to detect wrong unlock attempts right on the normal lock screen. I‚Äôve then coded some pretty complicated stuff to make the app take pictures without first showing a preview on the screen. CrookCatcher will then retrieve your phone‚Äôs GPS location and estimated address and send it together with the picture to your email.</p> <p>CrookCatcher uses <em>gmail</em> to send emails. This ensures complete transparency about which emails CrookCatcher sends and where your data goes. During the CrookCatcher setup process, you‚Äôll be asked to grant CrookCatcher access to a gmail account. You can create a new gmail account just for CrookCatcher or use an existing one (you can also use CrookCatcher without email). CrookCatcher only requests permission to send emails and cannot read, delete or modify any emails in your account. CrookCatcher does <em>automatic image compression</em> based on your network speed to ensure emails are sent as fast as possible, while keeping quality as good as possible.</p> <p>Here is a look at the email you will receive:</p> <figure class="blog-figure"><img src="/images/blog/email_preview_sm.jpg" alt="Receive photos and location directly in your email"> <figcaption>Receive photos and location directly in your email</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="is-it-all-free"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#is-it-all-free"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Is it all free?</h2> <p>No, but the <em>most important features are free</em>. This includes taking pictures and sending emails with location and photo. The price for <strong>CrookCatcher Pro</strong> depends on your country so you will have to look in the app to see it. But it‚Äôs pretty cheap! Considering the price of your phone (and your privacy), I think it‚Äôs a good investment. Below is a complete list of features in the free and pro versions.</p> <!> <h2 id="Ô∏è-what-if-the-thief-turns-on-airplane-mode-or-turns-off-the-device"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#Ô∏è-what-if-the-thief-turns-on-airplane-mode-or-turns-off-the-device"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>‚úàÔ∏è What if the thief turns on airplane mode or turns off the device?</h2> <p>The first thing a thief typically does after stealing a phone is turn on airplane mode or shut down the device. This prevents CrookCatcher from sending emails and tracking your device. So I implemented a feature that tries to prevent this or at least ensure we catch the thief before they do.</p> <p>When enabled, CrookCatcher will immediately turn off the screen if the power menu, quick tiles menu, or notification shade is detected on the lock screen‚Äîand while doing so, take pictures! This cannot prevent the thief from switching off the device by holding down the power button, but chances are they will try the normal way first and thus be caught by CrookCatcher!</p> <p>It was not easy to program this feature because it requires detecting these menus on the screen somewhat manually and it therefore doesn‚Äôt work on all devices. I‚Äôm working to improve this, but these features will likely remain ‚Äòexperimental‚Äô. Give it a try by going to the ‚ÄòExperimental Features‚Äô section in the app settings (it‚Äôs free!).</p> <h2 id="final-thoughts"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#final-thoughts"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Final Thoughts</h2> <p>I started building CrookCatcher for fun, but I kept going because I saw how useful it was to so many people. It has accumulated more than 8 million downloads and sent in total more than 400 million emails! Especially when people write in the comments that they managed to get back their stolen phone because of CrookCatcher! I hope this article was helpful to you. If you‚Äôre concerned about phone security like me, please give CrookCatcher a try!</p> <p>Best wishes, <br> Jakob H. ‚úåÔ∏è</p> <!> <figure class="blog-figure only-desktop" style="max-width: 250px;"><img src="/images/qr_codes/play_qr_source_blog_introducing_cc.png" alt="QR code to download CrookCatcher"> <figcaption>Scan to download CrookCatcher</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="frequently-asked-questions"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#frequently-asked-questions"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2> <h3 id="q-how-does-crookcatcher-affect-battery-life"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#q-how-does-crookcatcher-affect-battery-life"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Q: How does CrookCatcher affect battery life?</h3> <p>A: CrookCatcher only activates during incorrect unlock attempts, so battery usage is very minimal.</p> <h3 id="q-is-my-privacy-protected"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#q-is-my-privacy-protected"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Q: Is my privacy protected?</h3> <p>A: Yes!
