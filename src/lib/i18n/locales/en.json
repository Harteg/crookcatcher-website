        "question": "Why does CrookCatcher need access to my gmail account?",
        "answer": "Unlike other security applications, CrookCatcher does not rely on a third-party server for sending emails. Privacy is important, so CrookCatcher instead uses Google's authorization system OAuth2.0 to safely send emails directly from your device. This will not give CrookCatcher access to your email addresses or contacts. CrookCatcher will only use this permission to send security alert emails from your Gmail account to the email address defined by you from within the app."

      },
      "reboot": {
        "question": "Not working after reboot?",
        "answer": "Due to Android security precautions, your phone must be unlocked once after reboot for CrookCatcher to access the camera. I wish I could fix this, but unfortunately there is nothing I can do about it."

        "question": "Does CrookCatcher need internet?",
        "answer": "CrookCatcher works offline to detect unauthorized unlock attempts and capture data. An internet connection is however required to send alert emails. Due to Android restrictions, CrookCatcher sadly cannot automatically turn on and off data or Wi-Fi when needed."
