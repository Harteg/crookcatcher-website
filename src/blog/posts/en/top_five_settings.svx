## 🔐 1. Choose a Stronger Screen Lock

Your first and most important defense is your **screen lock**. A **password** provides the strongest security, but every lock type can be strengthened.

Here's how to make each type more secure:

- **Password** _Most secure choice!_<br> 
  Tip: A password with **six characters** instead of four is **3844X more secure**.

- **PIN code** _Very secure choice!_ <br>
  Tip: A **six-digit PIN** is **100X more secure** than a four-digit one.

- **Pattern lock** _Good choice!_<br>
  Tip: A pattern connecting **six dots instead of four** is **16X more secure**.

> Bonus tip: Avoid easy codes like 1234, 0000, or your birthday.

While biometric options like fingerprint and face unlock are convenient, keep in mind they can be used without your consent. For maximum security, consider relying only on a strong password.

## 🛡️ 2. Enable Android’s Theft Protection Features

Android 15+ now includes powerful **theft detection** tools designed to protect your device if someone grabs it and tries to run.

**Go to**:  
`Settings > Security & Privacy > Device Unlock > Theft Protection`

Enable these:

- **Theft Detection Lock**: Locks your screen if the phone detects it’s been snatched.
- **Offline Device Lock**: Locks your screen shortly after the device goes offline.

## 🛬 5. Remove Airplane Mode from Quick Settings

If a thief can swipe down and toggle **Airplane Mode**, they can **cut off tracking** instantly.

**Prevent this:**
1. Pull down the Quick Settings panel.
2. Tap the **edit (✏️)** icon.
3. Drag **Airplane Mode** out of the visible tile area.

> ✅ Pro tip: CrookCatcher can block access to Quick Settings entirely while your phone is locked. 👉 [Read the full guide here](/en/blog/block-power-menu)
